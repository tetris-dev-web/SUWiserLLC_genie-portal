      <p>Welcome to the Genie Portal, a prototype for what Progeny hopes to create for small to medium size real estate developers.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      With the aid of blockchain smart contracts, Progeny transforms your real estate holdings into a unique security token. All projects and purchases presented herein are for demonstration purposes only and as such operate via a mock ethereum blockchain with mock ether using the Ropsten test network.
      <br/>
